# Build a Magic 8-Ball with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The code for this Magic 8-Ball was designed for a hands on workshop for [Girlstart's Girls in STEM Conference in Houston](https://girlstart.org/our-programs/girls-in-stem-conference/houston-girls-in-stem-conference/) on October 5, 2019.

The workshop is intended for girls in grades 6th-8th, but can be used anyone who is curious about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

Participants will be introduced to HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the 3 fundamental languages of the internet; they will learn how to build and style basic web elements with HTML/CSS, and manipulate the DOM with Javascript. Participants will learn these concepts by building their own "Magic 8 Ball" online.
